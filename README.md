# Advancing Autonomy in Surgical Robotics: Sim2Real Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Generalization and Control

## Abstruct
The development of autonomous systems in surgical robotics presents significant challenges due to
the gap between simulation environments and real-world conditions, known as the Sim2Real gap.
This dissertation investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to enhance generalization
and control in robotic surgery, specifically for a needle reaching task. Modifications to the SurRoL
simulation platform were implemented, including domain randomization and the use of visionbased inputs. Two RL models were tested: TD3+HER with sparse rewards and recurrent PPO
with dense rewards. The TD3+HER model demonstrated rapid learning in controlled environments but struggled with generalization. In contrast, recurrent PPO, augmented with an LSTM
layer and dense rewards, showcased better adaptability in randomized environments, highlighting
its potential for real-world applications. These findings contribute to bridging the Sim2Real gap
and advancing autonomous capabilities in surgical robotics.
